# How to Get Unbanned on Gorilla Tag (2025 Guide) 🦍🚀

Getting banned from Gorilla Tag can feel like being tossed out of the jungle—frustrating and confusing, especially if you think it was a glitch in the matrix. This simple, friendly guide is here to help you swing back into the game by understanding what caused the ban and how to appeal it to get your account back on track!

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned right after making a fresh account, or does the ban follow you wherever you log in? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Gorilla Tag’s system could have flagged your device hardware, making it tricky to play even with a shiny new profile.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or messages from the Gorilla Tag moderators or platform admins to find out why. Frequent ban reasons include:
- Cheating, exploiting glitches, or using unauthorized mods  
- Toxic behavior like harassment or verbal abuse in-game  
- Account sharing, suspicious logins, or weird activity  

**Pro tip:** Before sending in your appeal, have a quick glance at Gorilla Tag’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.
